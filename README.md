--Note that a grade of C- or below means you may not count this course as a CSCI major course!

**Incomplete grades** will be given in case of a personal emergency that happens after the withdrawal deadline (Mar 20) and seriously compromises your ability to do the course work. Because time pressure is a fact of student life, I will not assign incomplete grades to give you more time to complete your work.

#CSCI 4760 Academic Honesty Policy
- **Programming Assignments** 1 through 5 are individual assignments. You may not help another student or get help from any other person except the instructor and teaching assistants. You may not incorporate code from any other source, including our textbook, except as specifically authorized by the instructor it. If you run across code that seems useful, you may study it, type it in and run it; but you must then erase it and write your own code.
- **Ethereal Exercises** from the text: you may work these on your own or with a partner (no groups larger than two, sorry). You may discuss ideas in the exercise with other students.
- **Other course exercises:** The exercise handouts provided for this course will not be graded. They are intended to help you practice the technologies that will be used in the individual assignments. You are welcome to work these in pairs or larger groups and to help other students. *Please do not copy code from another student, as this really does not help you learn the material. Please do not copy code from an exercise solution into an assignment solution.*
- **In–class tests:** During a written test you may not use any electronic communications device, talk with another student, or look at another students’ paper. If you need to borrow a pencil or other equipment during a test, talk to me instead of another student.

**Handling suspected violations:** As an instructor, I take pride in helping my students succeed. By the same token, I do not want students to get the same credential by cheating as my other students get by hard work.

If I suspect a violation may have occurred, I will first discuss it privately with the student(s) involved. If I still believe a violation has occurred, I will follow the procedures described in the [UGA Academic Honesty Policy](http://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy). These procedures provide due process and protect your rights as a student. Note, however, that penalties are severe and include getting an F in the course or even being expelled from UGA.
