Additional Details
------------------
The file to be sent is ~/file1
The output from Makefile runs is in ~/output with same names as target, ie: localhost, 2019, 2020, 2012
Wireshark capture files are in ~/tethereal with the same name as targets
The ~/log directory stores access and error logs.

Note: Iteration 5: communicate via the unreliable relayer with two of your classmakes. This was not completed because no Relayers were available. Also, strict CS academic dishonesty policies state students are not allowed to work together.
